# Nova Proxy 4.5.5

Nova Proxy 4.5.5 fixes the live Cloudflare usage box so the read-only token connects on the first try.

## Usage stats connect reliably

- The "Create read-only token" button now requests **Account Analytics: Read** and **Account Settings: Read** (both read-only). The analytics-only token it created before could read stats but could not list your account, so the panel could not auto-detect your Account ID and the usage box failed to connect.
- If auto-detection still cannot find your account, the panel now points you to the Account ID field and asks you to paste it (you can copy it from your Cloudflare dashboard URL).
- The token still cannot deploy or change Workers. It is read-only.

## Upgrade

Deploy the update with the Deploy to Cloudflare button, or merge the daily **Check for Nova updates** pull request after reviewing its diff and Cloudflare preview. Your users, settings, and data are preserved. Full deployment and update instructions are in [DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md).

The public repository contains only the obfuscated `worker.js` deployment artifact, its deployment metadata, checksums, and documentation. The maintainable panel source stays private.

# Nova Proxy 4.5.4

Nova Proxy 4.5.4 is a hardening release that lowers the deployed worker's static fingerprint. Runtime behavior is unchanged, so existing panels keep working exactly as before.

## A smaller static fingerprint

- A few internal constants that used to sit in the worker as plain text are now stored encoded and decoded at runtime, so a static scan of the deployed `worker.js` no longer surfaces them.
- This is a code-shape change only. Configs, connections, and every panel feature behave exactly as in 4.5.2.

# Nova Proxy 4.5.2

Nova Proxy 4.5.2 stops a dead or unresponsive proxy IP from hanging the worker.

## A silent proxy IP fails fast instead of hanging

- If a connection is routed through a proxy IP that accepts the connection but then never sends any data, the worker now closes it after a short wait instead of hanging until the runtime cancels the request.
- Only the wait for the first byte is bounded. Active connections, and legitimately idle-but-alive connections, are untouched.

# Nova Proxy 4.5.1

Nova Proxy 4.5.1 hardens the WebSocket handler so a malformed or scanner-probe connection closes cleanly instead of returning an internal error.

## Cleaner handling of bad connections

- A probe or malformed WebSocket connection now closes quietly instead of surfacing an internal error. This also removes a signal a scanner could use to fingerprint the worker as a proxy.
- Real client connections are unaffected.

# Nova Proxy 4.5.0

Nova Proxy 4.5.0 fixes subscription links, gives every user a stable TLS fingerprint, trims the Resistance Policy down to the toggles that actually change behavior, and makes the release build prove the artifact boots before it ships.

## Subscription links that resolve correctly

- Subscription links are now token-based, so each link maps to exactly one user account instead of leaning on the request path.
- The token travels with the link across every format (Auto, Base64, Clash), so a user's config imports the same way in any client.
- Links keep working after a worker rename or a domain change, because the token, not the hostname, identifies the account.

## A stable TLS fingerprint per user

- Each user now keeps one TLS fingerprint instead of drawing a new one on every connection.
- A consistent fingerprint is harder for a network to single out and block, and it stops a client from re-negotiating a different shape mid-session.

## Resistance Policy trimmed to what works

- Only the toggles that measurably change routing behavior remain; the switches that did nothing are gone, so the panel no longer promises more than it delivers.
- QUIC blocking now drives the real block: the panel switch maps to the actual QUIC drop rule, so turning it on blocks UDP 443 and turning it off restores it.
- Exit Location has been removed. It never changed the egress in a free-tier Worker, so it was misleading and is now off the page.

## Lighter connection accounting

- Per-connection limit accounting is lighter, cutting the bookkeeping overhead each connection pays and leaving more headroom on the free plan.

## A verified release build

- The release build now boots the packaged artifact before it is published, so a bundle that fails to start is caught at build time rather than on a user's Worker.

# Nova Proxy 4.4.x

The 4.4 line hardened multi-user state and simplified how configs are shared.

## Config sharing simplified

- Config sharing collapsed to three universal formats: Auto, Base64, and Clash. One link now imports into almost any client.

## Multi-user state protected

- Fixed a data-loss bug where saving Network Settings could clear the user list. Users, multi-user state, and the host pool are now preserved on every save.

## Panel and mirror polish

- Added a Quick actions panel to the dashboard and cleaned up the mobile Users screen.
- Hardened the GitHub mirror: the access token is trimmed before use, so a token pasted with extra whitespace no longer fails.
